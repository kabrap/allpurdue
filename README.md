## Purpose

There is no single centralized Purdue service to help boilermakers search for places to eat, study, or live. Our application targets all the Purdue students, alumni, and visitors in the West Lafayette area, who are looking for honest suggestions and want to share their unique experiences at and around the vibrant campus.

Individual review services like Yelp and Google exist where you can look up places and reviews, but there is no centralized platform that is tailored for Boilermakers; AllPurdue solves this problem by providing a convenient, streamlined platform acting as a one-stop service optimized for the people and visitors of Purdue. Whether it be a food place, residence hall, or study spots at Purdue, AllPurdue would have various locations in different categories containing ratings and reviews. 

While ratings and reviews of the places are the central features for services like this, AllPurdue does not only allow users to do that but a lot more, including creating blog posts. Through blog posts, users can write about their experiences in more detail, talk about their favorite places, etc., which also helps the other users make their decisions, as they get to know more than just quantitative information about the different places.
